## Canvas Language

The application uses a simple text-based language to describe shapes on the canvas. Each line represents one shape and follows this general format:

### Shape Types and Parameters

1. **Rectangle**: `rect(x y width height)`
2. **Circle**: `circ(centerX centerY radius)`
3. **Triangle**: `tri(x y width height)`
4. **Line**: `line(x1 y1 x2 y2)`

### Optional Parameters

- **Color**: Hexadecimal color code (e.g., `#ff0000`). Default is `#e74c3c`
- **Rotation**: Angle in degrees (e.g., `r45`)
